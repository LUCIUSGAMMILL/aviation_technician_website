            <h2>Typical Work Settings in New Mexico</h2>
            <p>Aviation technicians in New Mexico are employed in diverse settings, reflecting the state's aviation ecosystem.</p>

            <h3>Commercial Aviation</h3>
            <p>Major and regional airlines at Albuquerque International Sunport (ABQ) require technicians for line maintenance and heavy checks.</p>

            <h3>Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul (MRO) Facilities</h3>
            <p>MRO facilities in New Mexico employ technicians for extensive aircraft servicing and modifications.</p>

            <h3>Fixed-Base Operators (FBOs)</h3>
            <p>FBOs at general aviation airports across the state need A&P mechanics for routine maintenance and repairs.</p>

            <h3>Military Contractor Positions</h3>
            <p>New Mexico's military presence (Kirtland AFB, Holloman AFB, Cannon AFB) creates numerous civilian contractor positions for aircraft maintenance.</p>

            <h3>Specialized Aerospace Contractors</h3>
            <p>The Aerospace Corporation (AEC) in Albuquerque, a Federally Funded Research and Development Center (FFRDC), employs technicians with related skills for research support and systems integration [aec_location, aec_mission].</p>

            <h2>Nature of the Work</h2>
            <p>The work is physically and mentally demanding. Technicians often stand for long periods, climb, lift heavy components, and work in confined spaces. It involves diagnosing complex systems, interpreting technical manuals, and using precision tools. Accuracy and adherence to FAA regulations are critical.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Working Conditions</h2>
            <p>Conditions vary by employer and role. Shift work is common, especially in airline operations and MROs. A strong safety culture with PPE and rigorous procedures is universal. </p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Workforce Development (Example: AEC)</h2>
            <p>Some employers, like The Aerospace Corporation, emphasize workforce development with STEM outreach, internships, and university partnerships [aec_workforce_dev], offering potential for career growth. This focus on developing talent suggests internal pathways for growth and skill enhancement. The presence of such employers, particularly those like AEC linked to national security space programs [aec_mission, aec_location], provides unique career trajectories within New Mexico. These pathways may diverge from traditional airline or general aviation maintenance roles, offering opportunities to work on cutting-edge technologies and potentially requiring specialized skill sets beyond the standard A&P certificate. This diversification within the state's aerospace employment landscape adds another layer of opportunity for technicians seeking high-technology career paths.</p>
