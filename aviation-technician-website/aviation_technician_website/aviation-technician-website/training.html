            <h2>The Foundation: FAA Certification</h2>
            <p>Entry into the aviation maintenance profession is governed by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The fundamental credential is the Mechanic Certificate with Airframe and/or Powerplant (A&P) ratings [faa_mechanic_cert]. The FAA outlines two primary paths to eligibility for the required exams: attending an FAA-approved Aviation Maintenance Technician School (AMTS) under 14 CFR Part 147, or documenting practical experience [faa_mechanic_cert]. In New Mexico, the AMTS route through state institutions is the most common and structured pathway.</p>

            <h2>Key Training Providers in New Mexico</h2>
            <p>New Mexico features two prominent public institutions offering FAA-approved Part 147 Aviation Maintenance Technology programs, strategically located to serve different regions [cnm_amt_program, enmu_roswell_amt]. These programs represent a state investment in developing a skilled workforce for its targeted aerospace and defense sector [nm_dws_aerospace].</p>

            <h3>Central New Mexico Community College (CNM)</h3>
            <p>Located in Albuquerque, CNM provides an FAA Part 147 certified Aviation Maintenance Technology program [cnm_amt_program]. Its Albuquerque location offers proximity to the International Sunport (ABQ), facilitating potential internships and industry connections. The program typically spans five terms (approximately two years) and prepares students for all parts of the FAA certification exams [cnm_amt_program].</p>
            <blockquote>
                The CNM program delivers comprehensive training covering the FAA's required subjects in General, Airframe, and Powerplant sections, emphasizing hands-on learning in well-equipped facilities [cnm_amt_program].
            </blockquote>

            <h3>Eastern New Mexico University-Roswell (ENMU-Roswell)</h3>
            <p>Serving southeastern New Mexico, ENMU-Roswell also operates an FAA-approved Part 147 Aviation Maintenance Technology program [enmu_roswell_amt], offering Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree and certificate options. The curriculum covers the General, Airframe, and Powerplant knowledge areas required by the FAA, preparing students for certification [enmu_roswell_amt]. Its Roswell location places it near the Roswell Air Center (ROW), a significant hub for MRO and aircraft storage.</p>
            <blockquote>
                ENMU-Roswell's program provides in-depth instruction and practical application in aircraft maintenance, offering pathways to both an AAS degree and a certificate [enmu_roswell_amt].

        <section>
            <h2>Curriculum and Skills Development</h2>
            <p>The curricula at both CNM and ENMU-Roswell are structured around the FAA's required knowledge for A&P certification. Students learn aerodynamics, aircraft materials, federal aviation regulations, hydraulics, pneumatics, engine theory (reciprocating and turbine), electrical systems, basic avionics, structural assembly, welding, and inspection techniques. A strong emphasis is placed on hands-on learning in labs and hangars [cnm_amt_program, enmu_roswell_amt].</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Costs and Financial Aid</h2>
            <p>Prospective students should consider tuition, fees, tools, and testing costs. As public institutions, CNM and ENMU-Roswell generally offer more affordable tuition than private schools. Federal and state financial aid may be available, along with potential scholarships from industry organizations or the institutions themselves. Contact the respective institutions for detailed cost and financial aid information.</p>
